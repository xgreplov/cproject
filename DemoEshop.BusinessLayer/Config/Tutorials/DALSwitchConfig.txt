Switching DataAccessLayer requires following simple steps:

I.    Remove reference (from BL and its Tests, which can also be unloaded) to previous DAL project + corresponding infrastructure project and add references to desired DAL.
II.   Now import missing usings for entire project (via resharper) and remove unused usings to previous DAL.
III.  Finally go to BusinessLayerInstaller class and call corresponding DAL installer.
IV.   Launch the web app :)
