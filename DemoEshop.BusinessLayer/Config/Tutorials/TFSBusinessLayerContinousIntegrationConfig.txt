Setup CI for your BL a DALs:

I.    In visual studio, open Team Explorer, navigate to Visual Studio Team Services.
II.   Go to current project dashboard -> Build and Release -> .NET Desktop, than click on Apply.
III.  You are now located in the build process configuration, where you can setup your build pipeline, first set the Default Agent Queue combo box to: "Hosted VS2017" which means TFS will take care of the project build part, NuGet restore and also test run.
IV.   In the "Parameters" section below, pick your .sln file via explorer.
V.    If you use test framework like assumed NUnit, follow steps V.a) - V.d) other options are available at: http://bartwullems.blogspot.cz/2015/10/team-foundation-server-2015enable-nunit.html
V.a)  Go back to VS -> Extensions and updates -> Online -> Testing -> find NUnitTestAdapter 3.x and click install.
V.b)  After installing NUnitTestAdapter 3.x, obtain its .vsix file (from: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NUnitDevelopers.NUnit3TestAdapter)
V.c)  Rename the file extension from .vsix to .zip and extract its contents to created folder: <Your project root directory>\NUnitTestAdapter
V.d)  Go back to build process configuration, select the VsTest tab on the left side and scroll down to textbox named: "Path to custom test adapters", paste there following path: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)\NUnitTestAdapter
VI.   Now you have setup all the essentials within the build pipeline, click on "Save & Queue" to test if the configuration was made properly
VII.  If all went well, go to build process configuration and select Triggers tab where you can switch Continuous Integration on to automate the build pipeline with every check-in. Note that you get 4h/month build time per project for free.
VIII. You can inspect your build and test result in Build & Release section in Team Services (you may add it to your project dashboard), also you can inspect it from VS: Team Explorer -> Builds, clicking on the concrete build will redirect you to TFS site, with detailed information about passed/failed tests and so on.
IX.   To receive notifications (for instance when build is broken), go to: Team Explorer (Home) -> Settings tab -> Project Alerts -> New+ -> click on: "A Build Failes" -> Next -> setup email adresses and other stuff -> Finish.
